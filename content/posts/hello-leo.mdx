This guide will walk you through installing and running Leo, a programming language, on your computer. Leo is still under development, so to use its latest features, we'll install it directly from its source code.

## Prerequisites:

To get the most out of this project, the following are required:

- **Git**: Run `git --version` to verify you have git on your system. If not, install it from git [official documentation](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Rust**: This is the programming language Leo itself is written in. Don't worry, you won't need to know Rust to use Leo! Install rust here[https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install]

## Build Leo from Source Code

Now that you have the prerequisites, you can build and install Leo from its source code.

To download the source code on your terminal run the follow code

```
git clone https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo
```

Next change directory, run

```
cd leo
```

Now that you are in the leo directory, to build the leo from the source code and install the executable`~/.cargo/bin/leo` in your system, run

```
cargo install --path .
```

To start using Leo, run the following command

```
leo
```

If everything went well, Leo should launch and you'll see its interface as seen below.

## HELLO LEO

Now that you have Leo installed, let's create a simple program to get started.
Create a new Leo Project
Use the Leo Command Line Interface (CLI) to create a new project by running the command below on your terminal

```
leo new hello
```

This creates a new directory called "hello" with all the essential files for a Leo project which looks like the image below.

<Image src="/project-setup.png" width="718" height="404" alt="Image" />

Next, navigate into your directory

```
cd hello
```

Run the command below to build and execute your code

```
leo run main 1u32 2u32
```

Your output should look like the image below.

Congratulations! You've successfully created and ran your first Leo program
